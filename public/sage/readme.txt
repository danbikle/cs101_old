~/cs101/public/sage/readme.txt

The content in this folder is related to my adhoc efforts to learn: "Sage".

I found Sage at this URL:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/introduction.html

I may want to use Sage to help me bolster my understand and abilities with Math.

As of today, 2017-11-23, I don't know if Sage will help me with that task.

I will collect notes in this folder as I learn Sage.
