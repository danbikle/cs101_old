Here is the group which allows me "organizer-privileges":

I propose the following Meetup:

Title: Free Class: Intro to Python and Data Science

This Meetup is for beginners who want to learn Python and/or Data Science.

Python is a great way to learn Data Science.

Data Science is a great way to learn Python.

This is an actual class taught by a Data Scientist/Python Programmer.

It's not a power-point preso from the Marketing Dept.

We give you a chair, table, power, and WIFI.

We give you an hour of technical lecture followed by an hour of lab-time.

Bring your laptop.

This Meetup is small so we can give you individual attention.

If you RSVP, we ask that you make an effort to attend.

If the Meetup is oversubscribed, don't worry we will hold more Meetups.

This Meetup is offered by two educational services:

-- The Learning Center
-- CS101

The Learning Center offers high quality technical education to people between the ages of 9 and 99.

CS101 offers Computer Science education to adults.

Classes cover curriculum developed by engineers who know how to teach.
