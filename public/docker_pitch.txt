Meetup at the Learning Center at Maude and Mathilda.

Introduction to Docker!

Docker is software which can help you distribute software across a cluster.

This class introduces you to Docker.

We start by showing you how to start a host on Google-Cloud which has Docker installed.

Next we show you some of the simple ways that Docker can be operated.

After you understand simple Docker operations, we will help you attempt installation of Docker on your laptop.

Installing Docker on Mac is usually easy.

Installing Docker on windows can be difficult.

If you have problems installing or running Docker on your laptop, it is best to just run Docker on Google-Cloud.

In order to use Google-Cloud you will need a gmail account and a credit card.

Google will give you a $300 credit so you can learn how to run Docker and other software on Google-Cloud.

We will show you how to get that $300 credit and start using your Google-Cloud account.

The first hour of the Meetup is Lecture.

The second hour is Lab.

Feel free to attend just the Lecture and do the Lab at home.

RSVP if you intend to attend.
