sub: In Apache Beam, What does 'ExtractWords' do?

Hello world,

I am studying the Python syntax at this URL:

https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example/#applying-pipeline-transforms

I see this syntax:

    # The Flatmap transform is a simplified version of ParDo.
    | 'ExtractWords' >> beam.FlatMap(lambda x: re.findall(r'[A-Za-z\']+', x))

What is 'ExtractWords' ?

Is it the name of a function in the beam API?

Is it a comment?

Is it some kind of annotation for the line it resides in?

Why is 'ExtractWords' there?
