~/cs101/public/lesson004/notes2018_0228.txt

This file should hold notes I gather while I write lesson004.

I want to learn enough about serverless tech so I can quickly:
  - gather new prices
  - build new models
  - issue new predictions
  - for both:
    - stocks
    - forex


I looked at cloud-functions.
I see that they depend on JavaScript.
I'd prefer to use Python.
