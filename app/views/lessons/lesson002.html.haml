%h1#top Lesson 002 [ More Google GCP ]

%p I have taught this lesson several times now.

%p Most of this lesson is done with a browser.

%p I offer tips for success.

%ul
  %li Use Google-Chrome browser.
  %li Dedicate a new browser window to this lesson.
  %li If you need a browser to check news or e-mail, do it in another window.
  %li Get a new window with: File -> New Window
  %li Why? Because you want to avoid working in a window with many tabs.
  %li On a piece of paper, write down a useful tab-organization:
  %li
    %ul
      %li Tab 1: cs101.us
      %li Tab 2: codelabs
      %li Tab 3: github
      %li Tab 4: GCP 1
      %li Tab 5: GCP Cloud-Shell
      %li Tab 6: DataLab
      %li Tab 7: GCP 3

%p I started this lesson by creating a new Chrome-window.

%p I created 7 tabs in that window.

%p
  In tab 1 I loaded this URL:
  %a(href='http://cs101.us' target='x')
    http://cs101.us
  
%p
  In tab 2 I loaded this URL:
  %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/cp100' target='x')
    https://codelabs.developers.google.com/cp100
  
%p
  In tab 3 I loaded this URL:
  %a(href='https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform' target='x')
    https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform
  
%p
  In tab 4 I loaded this URL:
  %a(href='https://console.cloud.google.com' target='x')
    https://console.cloud.google.com
%p In tabs 5,6,7 I had done nothing (yet).  

%p After I created the 7 tabs, my Chrome-window looked like this:

%img(src='/lesson002/l200.png')
  
%p I clicked on tab 2, the codelabs-tab.

%p I continued this lesson by studying the URL listed below:
%p
  %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/cp100' target='x')
    https://codelabs.developers.google.com/cp100
%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson002/l201.png')
  
%p On that page I assume the correct ordering of links is listed below:

%ul
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-free-trial' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-free-trial
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-cloud-launcher' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-cloud-launcher
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-app-engine' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-app-engine
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-cloud-storage' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-cloud-storage
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-compute-engine' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-compute-engine
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-container-engine' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-container-engine
  %li
    %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-big-query' target='x')
      https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-big-query
  
%p The above links are discussed below:
%ul
  %li
    %a(href='#free-trial') free-trial

%hr/

%h2#free-trial Free-Trial

%p#free-trial Next, in the codelabs-tab, I clicked this link:

%p
  %a(href='https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-free-trial' target='x')
    https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cp100-free-trial
  
%p I saw a simple path through 4 pages.

%p The third page had a noteworthy URL I used to get $300 of cloud-credit from Google:

%p I loaded the URL into tab 3, the GCP-tab:
%p
  %a(href='https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial' target='x')
    https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial

%p
  I logged in using my gmail account.

%p
  It worked well; I gave it my credit-card info.
%p
  It gave me $300 of cloud-credit from Google.

%p
  I hope that you can also get that credit.

%p Next, I visited the URL listed below:

%p
  %a(href='https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate' target='x')
    https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate

%img(src='/lesson001/img003.png')

%p I used that page to create a project called cp100.
