%h1#top Lesson 011 [ Simple AWS Redshift Intro. ]

%p AWS Redshift is a database service.

%p This service runs in a cluster configured by you the operator.

%p The cluster offers higher reliability and sometimes better performance than a single-node database service:

%p This lesson shows how I worked through some simple AWS Redshift tasks.

%p To start, I Signed-Up for an AWS account.

%p I saw a Sign-Up button at this URL:

%a(href='https://aws.amazon.com' target='x')
  https://aws.amazon.com

%p After I signed-up and logged-in, using a link in the upper right, I set my region to Oregon:

%p

%hr/



%p I know that the Oregon region also has these names:
%ul
  %li Oregon
  %li US West (Oregon)
  %li us-west-2

%p The last name, "us-west-2", is important to remember.

%p After I set my region to us-west-2, I visited this URL:

%a(href='https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift' target='x')
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift
  
%p AWS served me a page called Redshift Dashboard.

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson011/z014.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Quick launch cluster".

%p AWS served me a form:

%img(src='/lesson011/z015.png')

%p I typed in a password for future connections:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code Dan12345

%p The option-field "Available IAM roles" was asking me to create a new IAM-Role.

%p I opened a another tab.

%p I visited URL:

%a(href='https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles' target='x')
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles
  
%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson011/z016.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Create role".

%p AWS served a page asking me a question:

%p Choose the service that will use this role

%p The page I saw:

%img(src='/lesson011/z017.png')

%p I answered by clicking the blue-Redshift link near lower right.


%p AWS served a page asking me a question:

%p Select your use case

%p The page I saw:

%img(src='/lesson011/z018.png')

%p I answered by clicking the blue-link: "Redshift - Customizable".

%p AWS highlighted my choice and activated blue-button: "Next: Permissions"

%p AWS served me page 2 from a wizard.

%p I typed "s3" into the search field.

%p AWS then allowed me to select this permission: "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess".

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson011/z019.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Next: Review".

%p AWS served me page 3 from a wizard asking me to name the Role I want.

%p I typed: "aRedshiftRole" and saw this:

%img(src='/lesson011/z020.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Create Role".

%p AWS created the role and served me Role-list page:

%img(src='/lesson011/z021.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "aRedshiftRole".

%p AWS showed the Amazon-Role-Name (ARN) of "aRedshiftRole" to be this string:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code arn:aws:iam::448496253599:role/aRedshiftRole

%p The page I saw is displayed below:

%img(src='/lesson011/z022.png')

%p I returned my attention to the Redshift-configuration page which needs "aRedshiftRole":

%img(src='/lesson011/z023.png')

%p I selected the option "aRedshiftRole":

%img(src='/lesson011/z024.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Launch Cluster".

%p AWS served me a page:

%img(src='/lesson011/z025.png')

%p After 5 minutes I visited a Redshift URL:

%a(href='https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift' target='x')
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift
  
%p Eventually I found the URL of the configuration page:

%a(href='https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/home?region=us-west-2#cluster-details:cluster=redshift-cluster-1' target='x')
  https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/home?region=us-west-2#cluster-details:cluster=redshift-cluster-1


%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson011/z026.png')

%p I wanted to open port 5439 into the cluster.

%p In the configuration page I clicked link: "sg-b0e2acc3" which was the link to VPC security groups.
