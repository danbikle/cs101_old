%h1#top Lesson 004 [ GCP Dataflow ]

%p GCP Dataflow is described in this URL:

%p
  %a(href='https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/' target='x')
    https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/

%p If you want a free GCP account to do this lesson, you should be able to get one:

%p
  %a(href='https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial' target='x')
    https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial
  
%p Google will want you to login using gmail.

%p Also they will want your credit-card information.

%p So, you should do that now.

%p Or, if you want, just keep reading.

%p To do this lesson, I needed only a browser.

%p I used a Chrome browser.

%p To start, I logged into gmail.

%p Next I loaded a URL:

%p
  %a(href='https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate' target='x')
    https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson004/df150.png')

%p I created a project:

%img(src='/lesson004/df151.png')

%p Notice in the above image that I did not use the suggested project-name.

%p Instead I called my new project: "dfnow".

%p Dataflow depends on a bucket:

%img(src='/lesson004/df153.png')

%p I created a bucket called "dfnow":

%img(src='/lesson004/df155.png')

%p I checked that it was available in the browser:

%img(src='/lesson004/df157.png')

%p Next, I loaded a URL:

%p
  %a(href='https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow' target='x')
    https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson004/df159.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "CREATE JOB FROM TEMPLATE".

%p GCP served me a form to fill out:

%img(src='/lesson004/df163.png')

%p I wanted to test if Dataflow would work for me.

%p So, I supplied minimal information to the form.

%p I clicked blue-button: "Run job".

%p GCP served me an error:

%img(src='/lesson004/df167.png')

%p I looked for help:

%img(src='/lesson004/df169.png')

%p I returned to URL:

%p
  %a(href='https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow' target='x')
    https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson004/df171.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Try Dataflow":

%img(src='/lesson004/df173.png')

%p It offered me help with my permission problem.

%p I clicked through:

%img(src='/lesson004/df175.png')

%p I clicked blue-button: "Enable APIs":

%img(src='/lesson004/df177.png')

%p It needed two minutes:

%img(src='/lesson004/df179.png')

%p It finished. I clicked blue-button, "CREATE JOB FROM TEMPLATE":

%img(src='/lesson004/df181.png')

%p GCP served me a form to fill out:

%img(src='/lesson004/df183.png')

%p I wanted to test if Dataflow would work for me.

%p So, I supplied minimal information to the form.

%p I clicked blue-button: "Run job".

%p Instead of serving an error, GCP launched a Job:

%img(src='/lesson004/df185.png')

%p I saw information about the job as it progressed:

%img(src='/lesson004/df187.png')

%p After 4 min 28 sec, it finished:

%img(src='/lesson004/df189.png')

%p I visited a URL to search for the job-output:

%p
  %a(href='https://console.cloud.google.com/storage' target='x')
    https://console.cloud.google.com/storage

%p I found it and clicked on a file in the dfnow-bucket:

%img(src='/lesson004/df191.png')

%p I saw output from the job:

%img(src='/lesson004/df193.png')

%p After I studied the files, I deleted them from the bucket:

%img(src='/lesson004/df195.png')


%p At that point I was convinced that I had the permissions I need to submit Dataflow-jobs.

%h2#python Python DataFlow

%p I started this effort by activating Cloud-Shell:

%img(src='/lesson004/df200.png')

%p I clicked button on the right to give Cloud-Shell its own tab:

%img(src='/lesson004/df202.png')

%p I like to have my Cloud-Shell tab to the right of my GCP-tab:

%img(src='/lesson004/df204.png')

%p I visited a URL and studied it:

%p
  %a(href='https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-python' target='x')
    https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-python
%p I should have started there.

%p The above page offers information on how to avoid the API-permission-error I encountered.

%p In Cloud-Shell-tab I issued commands:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      virtualenv venv10
      \. venv10/bin/activate
      pip install google-cloud-dataflow
%p That quickly finished.

%p Then, I prepared two shell variables for a large Python command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      env|grep PROJECT
      export BUCKET=gs://dfnow

%p I launched a Dataflow-job using Python:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson004a'

%p Much text flew by in the tab; I captured some:

%img(src='/lesson004/df206.png')

%p Eventually it finished:

%img(src='/lesson004/df208.png')

%p In the buckets-Browser, I looked for output from the job:

%img(src='/lesson004/df210.png')

%p I found output from the job:

%img(src='/lesson004/df212.png')

%p After I that output, I returned to the buckets-Browser and removed files from that job.

%p That concludes this lesson on GCP-Dataflow.
