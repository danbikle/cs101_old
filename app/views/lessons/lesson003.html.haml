%h2#anaconda Anaconda

%p Anaconda runs on Mac, Windows, and  Linux.

%p I started by downloading Anaconda 5.1.0 for my laptop:

%ul
  %li
    Mac:
    %a(href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XasIhnctEdHKkWFt8aK_-2goVgo_KV8_' target='x')
      https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XasIhnctEdHKkWFt8aK_-2goVgo_KV8_
  %li
    Windows:
    %a(href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QqaRx4UvpneVMzLZShIzeamE0rPvrj8C' target='x')
      https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QqaRx4UvpneVMzLZShIzeamE0rPvrj8C
  %li
    Linux:
    %a(href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WULX7krUKayH0l4BVIb3dCr0Z3i-gQHR' target='x')
      https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WULX7krUKayH0l4BVIb3dCr0Z3i-gQHR

%p If I want an Anaconda version other than 5.1.0, it should be available here:

%p
  %a(href='https://repo.continuum.io/archive/' target='x')
    https://repo.continuum.io/archive/

%p After I downloaded it, I started the install by clicking on the download.

%p During the install, I answered yes to all the defaults.

%p After I installed Anaconda, I saw this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson003a'

%p I verified installation with shell commands:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson003b'

%h2#jupyter Jupyter

%p Jupyter is an interesting application.

%p You can learn a bit about Jupyter at the URL listed below:
%p
  %a(href='http://jupyter.org/' target='x')
    http://jupyter.org/
%p I see Jupyter as a mashup of a Python interpreter and Web technology.

%p I can use Jupyter to expose some Python syntax to a group of people who are running browsers who then want to see that syntax run in their browswers.

%p I bumped into Jupyter in two types of situations.

%p The first type is what I call the presentation-training-scenario.

%p If I present a small amount of Python based content to a room full of Python programmers, Jupyter can be a good fit for that task.

%p The second type is what I call the development-scenario.

%p In this situation I need to write some code to deliver a feature in a production app.

%p Is the production app running in Jupyter?

%p Probably not.

%p So to me it's obvious that Jupyter makes a poor development environment.

%p So I remember two points:
%ul
  %li Jupyter is good for training.
  %li Jupyter is poor for development.

%p To start Jupyter I typed a simple shell command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code jupyter notebook

%p The above command should work on both Mac and Linux.

%p On windows you should find the right icon and then click on it.

%p On windows if you have trouble, I offer a tip:

    https://www.google.com/search?q=On+windows+how+to+start+Jupyter

%p On my laptop after I typed: "jupyter notebook", I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson003/jup1.png')

%p On the right, I clicked the new-link and I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson003/jup2.png')

%p I typed in some Python syntax:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code print('hello jupyter.')

%p I pressed the enter-key.

%p That just made the field larger.

%p I entered shift-enter.

%p Python came to life and ran that Python syntax:

%img(src='/lesson003/jup3.png')

%p Now you know enough Jupyter to learn some Python.

%h2#python Python

%p Here is some Python:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code print("Hello, Python!")

%p Try to copy-paste it into Jupyter.

%p Then in Jupyter, use shift-enter to run it.

%p I did that.

%p First, I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson003/jup4.png')

%p Then, I pasted:

%img(src='/lesson003/jup5.png')

%p Then, I pressed shift-enter:

%img(src='/lesson003/jup6.png')

%p If you can do that in your laptop, you are on the right path.

%p Time to move along.

%p I show you More python below.

%p Try to slowly and carefully run pieces of it in Jupyter:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson003py4ds1'

%a(href='#top') [top]
%hr/
   
%h2#ds Data Science

%p To do this exercise I shutdown Jupyter.

%p Then I downloaded two CSV files into my Downloads folder on my laptop:

%ul
  %li
    %a(href='/lesson003/boston_housing_data.csv') boston_housing_data.csv
  %li
    %a(href='/lesson003/family.csv') family.csv

%p I wanted Jupyter to see those two files.

%p So, I used two shell commands to start Jupyter from the Downloads folder:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~/Downloads
      jupyter notebook
      
%p Here is some Python which introduces you to Data Science.

%p I ran the Python in my Jupyter Notebook and it worked well:
 
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson003py4ds2'

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson003/ds10.png')

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson003/ds11.png')

%p I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson003/ds12.png')
