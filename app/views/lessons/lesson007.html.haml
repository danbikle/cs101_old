%h2#top Lesson 007 [Google Machine Learning Crash Course]

%p This lesson shows how I stepped through some ML content from Google.

%p I started by logging into gmail; the class goes smoother after I login to gmail.

%p I visited the URL listed below:

%p
  %a(href='https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course' target='x')
    https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course

%p I clicked a button: "VIEW PREREQUISITES".

%p I landed at this page:
%p
  %a(href='https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework' target='x')
    https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework

%p I studied that page.

%p I gathered up all the Python syntax into one place and pasted it below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson07a'

%p Next, I studied this section:
%p
  %a(href='https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework#low-level-tensorflow-basics' target='x')
    https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework#low-level-tensorflow-basics

%p Next, I studied this page:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator' target='x')
    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator
%p The above page led me to some questions:

%ul
  %li
    The estimator wraps a model, what does that mean?
  %li
    How to use an estimator to wrap a straight-line linear model?
  %li
    What is a checkpoint?
  %li
    What are Hyperparameters?




%p Also, during that study, I studied this page:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.7/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py' target='x')
    https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.7/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py

%p Next, I sent a question to Google:
%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=In+Machine+Learning+what+is+an+estimator' target='x')
    https://www.google.com/search?q=In+Machine+Learning+what+is+an+estimator

%p I found some answers I like:
